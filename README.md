# Amsilla Editor
The Amsilla Editor is a powerful and lightweight editor in any way. It can be used as a code editor, a text editor, and more! It can be customized however you like it, and you can add special features with callback functions.

The editor that powers VS Code, Monaco Editor, is much slower than the Amsilla Editor. Monaco Editor typically lags out at a thousand lines, in just plain text mode!
Most long programs take up several thousand lines.
Amsilla Editor begins lagging at nearly ten times that amount, making Amsilla Editor the much speedier editor.
If you don't believe this, you can try it out yourself!

Amsilla Editor is easy to implement. Just add this code to your website:
`<script src="https://fairies-feast.github.io/amsilla-editor/editor.js"></script>`
You change parts of it, or use the original CSS code:
`<link href="https://fairies-feast.github.io/amsilla-editor/editor.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'/>`
