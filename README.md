# Amsilla Editor
The Amsilla Editor aims to be an easy-to-use powerful web editor with ultimate extensibility.

Monaco editor uses several ineffecient functions, and typically lags out (when using plaintext mode) after just a thousand lines of code.
Amsilla editor, on the other hand, starts lagging after three times that amount.

**Though it was made to be a code editor, Amsilla Editor will work from recreating Google Docs to just modifying the HTML Input/Textarea element.**
